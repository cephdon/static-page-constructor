## Why?

Whenever I need to create some static site, be it for marketing or informational purposes, I opt for S3 Static Site hosting. I’m not a big fan of using EC2 for the sake of a simple static site.

The average static site I own costs around 0.14$ a month! Combined with API backend it can be a good option for any site. Besides, search engines become more proficient in parsing Single Page Applications by day.

But, at the same time, I want to be able to change text, images, or the whole blocks without having to redeploy the site manually.

What I need is a simple, serverless CMS that will generate a static site, so I don’t have to pay for not utilized resources like EC2 instance hosting WordPress/Joomla/Drupal/etc.

I realize the are a lot of “Build yourself a site in 10 minutes with our drag&drop features” services available, but I don’t want to go “Premium” to use a custom domain, template, stylesheet or whatever.
